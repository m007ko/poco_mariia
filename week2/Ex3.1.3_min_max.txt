Ex. 3.1.3 (*) - Which number is bigger? ca. 15 min
Declare 2 variables, both numbers. Compare which number is greater Log the 
output, e.g. "The greater number
of 5 and 10 is 10." Add an output for the else statement, e.g. "The 
smaller number of 5 and 10 is 5."

Solution:
1) Declarate 2 variable 
x1, x2 - number (float)
2) Ask user to imput 2 numbers, check if both is the numbers, if not - 
write message "Write numbers"
3) Create function max 
max (x1, x2) = if x1 > x2 outfut will be x1. otherwise x2.
4) Create function min
min (x1, x2) = if x1 < x2 outfut will be x1. otherwise x2. 
5) Ran function min and max
6) Print ""The greater number of x1 and x2  is max (x1, x2)." 
"The smaller number of x1 and x2  is min (x1, x2)."
